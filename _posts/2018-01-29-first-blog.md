This is my attempt to write about my experience with different technologies, algorithms, machine learning and at times about
life and people in general. I have been very fortunate in my life to have opportunities that were presented to me. Ofcourse, I realized
this little late but you live and learn. I think that is more important. Life should be about evolution and trying to be
the better version of your everyday.
