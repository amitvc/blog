This is my attempt to write about my experience with different technologies, algorithms, machine learning and at times about
life and people in general. As a starter post I promise to keep it short.I have been very fortunate in my life to have opportunities that were presented to me. Ofcourse, I realized
this little late but you live and learn. I think that is more important. Life should be about evolution and trying to be
the better version of yourself everyday. I am forever grateful to many people who have helped me in life so far. They know who they are.
As promised this post will be short and sweet.
