#### Introduction
In this blog post I will try to give an intuition behind recursion and also discuss things that helped me understand the topic very well. Grasping recursion truly opens up solutions to many programming problems which otherwise would have to be coded with quite a bit of complexity.

#### What is recursion?
Many programming text books call recursion as function that calls itself. Although the definition is sound but I feel it is incomplete and does not make a point of why and where recursion comes into play. I like to describe recursion as solving problems by breaking them down into smaller but similar subproblems. The solutions of the smaller subproblems are then combined to solve the larger subproblem.
